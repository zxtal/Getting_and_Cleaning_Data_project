This repo contains the R script (run_analysis.R) and the associated codebook file (CodeBook.MD) for the Coursera’s Getting and Cleaning Data week 4 project exercise. This exercise used the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, which is accessible via the link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

The script requires the support from the dplyr, reshape2 and plyr packages. Please make sure these packages are installed and attached before running the script. To run the script, set current working directory to “./UCI HAR Dataset/” and place the script in the same directory and type source(“run_analysis.R”). For detailed explanation on the codes and the generated datasets, please refer to the “CodeBook.MD” file.
